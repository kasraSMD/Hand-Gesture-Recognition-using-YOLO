# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-using-YOLO
This project focuses on **Hand Gesture Recognition** using the YOLO object detection model. The system is designed to detect and classify 15 different hand gestures in real-time, making it ideal for applications like gesture-based control, sign language interpretation, and more.

## Dataset

- **Classes:** The dataset includes 15 distinct hand gestures.  
- **Images:** 200 images were captured for each gesture, resulting in a total of **3000 labeled images**.
- **Annotation:** Images were labeled using the [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) tool, generating `.xml` files for each image.  
- **Dataset Split:**  
  - **Training Set:** 2700 images.  
  - **Validation Set:** 300 images.

## Workflow

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- **Step 1:** Hand gesture images were captured using a webcam and saved into folders named after the gesture classes using the Python script `F1_GenerateDataset.py`.  
- **Step 2:** Images were labeled using the LabelImg tool, and `.xml` files were generated.  
- **Step 3:** The `.xml` files were converted to YOLO-compatible `.txt` annotation files using the Python script `F2_CreateYOLO_Dataset.py`.  
- **Output:** The YOLO annotations are stored in the `YOLO_labels` folder.

### 2. Model
- The YOLO 11 Large model (`yolo11l.pt`) was used as the base model for training and fine-tuning.

### 3. Training
- The model was trained for **100 epochs** with **EarlyStopping** (patience=20) implemented to prevent overfitting.  
- **Optimizer:** Standard YOLO optimizer settings were used.  
- **Training/Validation Split:**  
  - Training: 2700 images.  
  - Validation: 300 images.  

### 4. Evaluation
- The model was evaluated on the validation dataset, producing the following results:

## Usage

### Real-Time Gesture Detection
To use the trained model for real-time hand gesture recognition, run the `HandGestureRecognition.py` script.

```bash
python HandGestureRecognition.py
```

### Model Weights
- The best model (`best.pt`) and the last model (`last.pt`) are stored in the `runs` folder.  
- You can use these weights for further testing or deployment.
